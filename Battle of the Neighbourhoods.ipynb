    "Every new business considers a number of factors before setting up shop for the firs time. One of the main risks for a business is the crime rate within a neighbourhood; the inference here is that a lower crime rate will not only mean a safer business and employees but also have customers that feel safe shopping. This project aims to explore the neighbourhoods and boroughs in the city of Vancouver, Canada, and recommend area(s) for opening up a new grocery store based on the level of safety and then within these safer regions choose the borough where there may be a higher need for a grocery store."
